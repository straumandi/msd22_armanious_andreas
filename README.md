# SevenCalc

## What is SevenCalc?
This is a short brain work game that challenges players to solve seven calculations as quickly as possible. The game tracks both the average time needed to solve the calculations and the individual time needed for each calculation. This provides valuable feedback for players who want to improve their performance.
The game is built as a Java application, which means it works on all platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. The CLI program is simple and intuitive, with clear instructions on what the user has to do.
This brain work game is a fun and challenging way to exercise your brain and improve your basic mental math skills.

## Requirements
- Java 17 or higher

You will need java on your local machine, **Java version 17 or higher** is recommended, since the application is written with Java 17. 

## Installation
If you are not sure how to install java properly on your machine, [here](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-java-windows-ubuntu-macos/) is a link to help you out.

## How To Play
With java installed on your machine, you can start the application in the **command line**(bash for unix based systems like Linux and MacOS) or the PowerShell for Windows systems.

1. Compile Java source code: First navigate to the src folder of the project, then use the `javac Application.java`  command to compile the Java source code of the Application.java into bytecode.

2. Run the application: Once the code is compiled, you can run the application using the `java Application` command, since the compiled classes name is "Application".

For now i am developing this simple program on my own, but i'm very open to contributors for a more fun and complex future version.

## Roadmap
It is planned to integrate a **menu** with the following **difficulties** to choose:
- **easy**
- **medium**
- **hard**
- **math expert**

The goal is it to make the game a little bit more flexible, therefore it can be appealing for different levels of mental math skills. With increasing difficulty, the max. time for solving the calculations will be shorter. For the hardest mode **math expert** the calculations will be harder and the time frame available will also be very tight.
