# Logging with Log4J

This document provides an overview of Log4J, a popular logging library used in Java applications.

## Purpose of Logging Libraries

- Logging libraries are important for good software development and maintenance.
- They enable developers to track program events, debug code, monitor performance, and ensure compliance.

## Log Levels in Log4J

- Log4J offers different log levels to categorize log messages by severity.
- The 5 log levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL.
- Developers can set the appropriate log level to control the verbosity of log output.

## Configuration Options in Log4J

- Log4J provides flexible configuration options to customize its behavior.
- These options include:
    - Appenders: Define where log messages are sent (e.g., console, files, databases).
    - Layouts: Specify the format of log messages (e.g., timestamp, log level, message).
    - Loggers: Manage the logging hierarchy and control behavior for different parts of the application.
    - Filters: Apply filters to selectively process or discard log events based on specific criteria.
