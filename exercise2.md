# Git basics
**Here you can see the most common git commands and what they do:**

- **git config** (get and set repository or global configuration for git) [(more info here)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)
- **git init** (initialize local git repository in current directory)
- **git commit**  (file has a new version, added files/ staged files have been added to this new version, also the changes are being recorded)
- **git status**  (print current status of files in local git repository)
- **git add** (add as argument passed files to staged area)
- **git log** (shows commit history of repository, a list of all commits and the according data)
- **git diff** (shows changes between commits, commit and working tree)
- **git pull** (pulls from remote repository and integrates into current local branch)
- **git push** (pushes to remote repository on the current configured branch)

These commands are **fundamental** in using Git for version control and collaborating with others on software projects.
